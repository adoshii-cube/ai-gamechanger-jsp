                                    We have all, at some point in our lives, made New Year resolutions with great gusto and fervor – only to watch them crumble in the next few days. According to one statistic, 95% of people are unable to stick to their resolutions beyond the first 30 days. So what makes the 5% successful?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And how is this relevant to people analytics?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As HR professionals, we have by now come across “HR Analytics” in one form or another. We have also seen business increasingly demand that we leverage people data to create additional value. A lot is happening in this space; check out <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/40-best-hr-analytics-articles-h2-2016-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card target="_blank">David Green’s latest compilation of the Top 40 articles in people analytics.</a>

                                <p>
                                    As we get ready for 2017, now would be a perfect time to embark on our people analytics journey. To take that first step, to make a New Year resolution to – <b>“Leverage people analytics to uncover at least one actionable insight that delivers real value to the business.”</b> And let us make our resolution stick!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Here are 5 simple steps to make your New Year resolutions stick:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        1. Prioritize before picking
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    It is important to prioritize our wish-list and pick one resolution that is most important to our overall goals. On the personal front, from the many aspirations – reduce weight, learn an instrument, spend more time with family etc., pick one that keeps you motivated. On the professional front, this may be one of the many strategic objectives of HR for the year, e.g. reduce unwanted attrition, enhance productivity, improve quality of hires etc. Pick one that ensures executive support - very essential if you ultimately wish to move the needle. To jump start your knowledge of people analytics, here is an easy but highly useful course on <a href=https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-people-analytics target="_blank">Coursera</a>
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        2. Set achievable targets
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    Overambitious goals are one of the main reasons that resolutions fall through. Setting small, achievable targets are essential to success, such as losing 2lbs. in 2 months. While HR’s strategic objective may be to reduce unwanted attrition by 10%, an initial target could be to identify the top 3 drivers leading to attrition.
                                </p>

                                    There are several books that provide great insights on the value people analytics can deliver. Some of my favorite ones (in no particular order) are:

                                        3. Enlist support of others

                                <p>
                                    The people around us are crucial in helping us succeed in our resolutions. We need our friends and family to watch what we eat and push us to exercise regularly. Similarly, we need to enlist the support of, and collaborate with, other functions (such as finance, operations) to share relevant data, communicate key insights, and together help solve the problem.
                                </p>

                                        4. Use professional help to kick-start the process

                                    Professionals have helped several others take the same journey successfully. They know the tricks of the trade, and can help you avoid common pitfalls. Dieticians and personal trainers not only provide you with a plan, but also help you stick with it. In the world of HR analytics, there are a several specialist service providers that have expertise in your area of interest and can support you in your journey. Professionals such as <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewspencehrtransformation target="_blank">Andrew Spence</a>, are globally known for their expertise and experience in helping organizations take this path.

                                    It is important to have fun and celebrate small successes along the way. Reward yourself with a special treat at the end of the week. Create interesting visualizations to share stories and insights that you find in the data discovery process. This is essential to keep the momentum going until you reach your goals.
