                                <p>
                                    Thomas was a straight-A student right through. He went to a premier engineering college, an Ivy League business school, and was recruited directly from campus by a top-notch management consultancy.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    He was not only bright, but also eager to learn. His excellent social skills made him liked by everyone around him. It was no surprise then that his career took-off in a steep trajectory. He earned handsome bonuses every year and got steadily promoted. Soon he would be Director, with a significant pay increase.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On the personal front too, Tom had gotten married to his longtime girlfriend last year and they had moved into a nice house in the suburbs. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Everything was perfect. Well, almost…
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Lately, Tom had observed that he wasn’t getting as fired up about work as before. Once the center of attention, he was finding his interactions with his colleagues less meaningful - often tending to purely transactional. He noticed that he increasingly wanted to leave early from work. Even the commute from the suburbs was starting to bother him. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Was he ready for the Director role? Did he really want to do this?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Then one day Mark, the VP of his region called him in for a one-on-one discussion. “We’re starting up a new division”, Mark explained. “We want to productize some of our services. And given your background and experience, you would be perfect to lead this division. The pay raise may be not as much but there will be other benefits such as flex timings and work from home opportunities. The opportunity is yours, if you want it.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Tom was stunned... It was perfect! He was sure that this would once again get him excited about his work. In fact, he had always wanted to put his technical skills to use. How could they have known? Was it a coincidence?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “It’s really quite simple”, said Mark. “We have started extensively using AI based tools to help better manage our employees.” He went on to explain further, “Our analytics models monitor dozens of internal and external data points on an ongoing basis, and identify employees at risk. Your risk profile went from low to medium the moment you bought a house 30 miles from the city. Then over a period of time your interaction patterns with your colleagues started changing, indicating lower engagement and motivation. The system picked this up by measuring a consistent decrease in the number of messages exchanged by you. This put your risk profile to high. We wanted you to stay but didn’t know how…
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Here again, big data analytics came to our rescue. The system picked up that you had recently started liking several articles related to innovation and design thinking on Linkedin. This new insight gave us the way forward. Your interest in innovation fits perfectly with company’s plans of productization. All we needed to do was put together the right opportunity in front of you.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Tom stayed, and went on to excel in his new role in the organization.
                                </p>
                                <p>
