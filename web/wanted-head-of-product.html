                                    As we plan to hire a Head of Product to start developing the next version of OWEN, I am reminded of my good friend and ex-colleague, Yvonne. Yvonne used to head HR for a mid-sized technology company in Southern California which had grown rapidly in the initial years but had recently started slowing down. There were some initial signs of disquiet in the workforce – the product development team seemed particularly vulnerable. The Head of Product has just quit and there was no one to anchor the team in these turbulent times. Yvonne needed to find a replacement quickly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The CEO’s preference was to promote someone from within, as this would ensure continuity and help improve team morale. The idea was sound. The execution however, was no easy task. There were 3 potential candidates, each deserving of the opportunity in their own way.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There was Chris, the bright-eyed kid from Caltech who was doing great work and chomping at the bit for the opportunity to step-up. Then there was Roger, the seasoned hand. Roger had risen through the ranks over the years, was a solid performer, and was also highly recommended by the Director of Engineering. And finally there was Lynn, who was an import from another technology company in the valley. Lynn was sharp, experienced and very likeable.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Yvonne initially thought of consulting with team leaders within engineering but decided against it. Individual opinions were likely to be biased, and would only add to the confusion. She then decided to run a confidential survey across the whole team, using just 5 simple questions:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        Who would you like to appreciate for helping you in your day-to-day job? (Name up to 5 individuals)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Who do you go to for career related questions/ discussions? (Name up to 5 individuals)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Who do you feel most comfortable discussing new ideas/ new ways of doing things with? (Name up to 5 individuals)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Who do you feel comfortable talking about non-work issues with? (Name up to 5 individuals)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Please let us know what concerns you have about your team/ organization.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>
                                    It was reinforced multiple times that the survey was <b>strictly confidential</b>. Aggregated findings would be shared with everyone but individual names will not be disclosed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Responses came in over the next few days, and the insights were nothing short of astounding. Yvonne had discovered how the organization really worked, and this made her job of finding the next Head of Product quite easy.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Chris was brilliant but not social. A few individuals had named him for conversations related to day-to-day work and for discussing new ideas, but not for any others. Chris was more of an individual contributor. Roger had been identified by several individuals for day-to-day work advice and only by a few for career discussions. Roger was more of a technical expert. Lynn was central in career discussions, innovation conversations, as well as non-work discussions. Lynn was not only a mentor but also a key influencer. Additionally from the open text question (Q5), Yvonne could identify that individuals linked with Lynn were more positive and upbeat about their team and the direction of the business. The choice was clear. Lynn was not only a good leader but also a great motivator, and thus the best fit for the Leadership role.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Using Organization Network Analysis, Yvonne had resolved a big succession issue for her organization.
