                                    As a cross-industry disruptor, blockchain is likely to have a profound impact on the future of work. In order to begin to understand the magnitude of impact this technology could have, let us first look at some of the key attributes of the blockchain:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Transparency:</b> Blockchain is a distributed database. It is cleverly designed such that the metadata of all transactions is publicly available to all the participants, however private sensitive data is cryptographically anonymized.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Immutability:</b> Once data is written on a blockchain no one, not even a system administrator can alter it. Once a “transaction” is validated by the chain’s participants it gets recorded and sealed on the blockchain with a time stamp. Once the block is sealed, its contents can never be changed.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Time stamping:</b> Every transaction or record on the blockchain has a time stamp. This helps clearly establish the chronology of transactions stored in the database.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>P2P platform:</b> Blockchain is a peer-to-peer platform that eliminates the need for third party brokers. It enables secure transactions through consensus based algorithms and advanced cryptography. This means one does not need a clearing house such as a bank to validate a transaction.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Secure digital currency:</b> The distributed nature of the blockchain means there is no single point of attack on the database. Additionally, the use of advanced cryptography means that it is extremely hard (nearing to impossible) to hack into an account or alter the structure of the blockchain.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <br>
                                <h4>Applications in the workplace</h4>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Resumes become more authentic and eventually redundant:</b>
                                        <p>Blockchain can store education qualification details of individuals as an immutable record, making it truly authentic. This becomes especially useful for verifying and tracking professional qualifications and licenses such as those of pilots, doctors, and lawyers. Storing the details of actual work done is not that straight forward yet but can be done for professions such as software developers where proof of work is available in public domains such as Github, Stack Overflow etc. Eventually, resumes could become redundant with all relevant details stored on a public blockchain accessible to anyone.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Background checks become automated:</b>
                                        <p>Similarly, the personal history of an individual can be stored on a blockchain with all records on it easily verifiable. This sort of a blockchain could be run by governments, thus ensuring authentic information on each individual including legal status, work authorization, tax information etc. Eventually, a background check would be a simple query into this database and eliminate the need for tedious manual processes.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Recruiting becomes fast and accurate:</b>
                                        <p>Blockchain provides the ability for people to maintain – and control access to – a comprehensive, trustworthy blockchain-based record of their education, skills, training and workplace performance. By providing this access to potential employers, the job-matching can become much more efficient as well as effective.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Smart contracts:</b>
                                        <p>By virtue of it being a P2P network, smart contracts can be developed between task buyers (employers or anyone who needs to get a task done) and task performers (employees, freelancers, contractors etc.). These smart contracts specify the terms of engagement and are automatically executed when those terms are fulfilled. This removes the need for trust and cumbersome legal processes and enables fulfillment of obligations (such as payments) in a transparent and efficient manner.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Local and Cross-border payments become seamless:</b>
                                        <p>Digital currencies developed over a blockchain network such as Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. enable payments in real-time (almost) to anyone, anywhere in the world with minimal transaction fees. This is a significant benefit in providing services across borders.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Benefits can be accrued and ported over different employers:</b>
                                        <p>Not only can a digital currency be used to pay wages, it can also be used to pay for benefits. The currency would be easily interchangeable with the local fiat currency, thus enabling seamless provision of benefits and care. This makes the benefits portable across employers, thus significantly removing barriers to employee mobility.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                
                                <p>
                                    These and many such applications are likely to appear using this disruptive technology to fundamentally overhaul jobs and work as we know today. The next few years promise to be exciting…
