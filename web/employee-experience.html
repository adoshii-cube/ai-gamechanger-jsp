                                <p>
                                    We are rapidly entering a workplace where machines are able to perform not just standardized repeatable tasks but also simple cognitive ones. Soon, machines will be able to learn and interact with humans naturally and become our full-time co-workers, often replacing some of our human counterparts.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The human workforce needs to adapt to this new reality and up-skill themselves to not only work efficiently alongside robots but also effectively leverage them. This means that the unique human capabilities of emotional intelligence, intuition and judgment will be critically important to do higher order tasks that machines cannot do. As humans, we are best able to perform these tasks when we are motivated by our mission, feel appreciated for our accomplishments, and are connected with others around us.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In other words, understanding the employee experience holistically is imperative for organizations. Only then can organizations proactively identify issues and enable development of an energizing, rewarding and supportive work culture.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Fortunately, we now have technology readily available to help us measure all these elements of the employee experience in a non-intrusive manner. This can be accomplished by:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Motivation: Simple questions targeted to the employee based on their specific business context can help identify issues proactively (for example: employees who have just completed onboarding may be asked about the efficacy of the onboarding process, while those who are in the midst of a long, challenging project may be asked about role of managers in ensuring employee motivation). A pulse-survey approach can help get feedback well in time when the issues are still relevant and on top-of-mind of employees. The questions can be simple Likert (5 or 10-point) scale or open-text.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Peer recognition: Simple mechanisms for anonymous peer-recognition can make employees feel instantly rewarded for their efforts. This also promotes a healthy 360 degree appreciation culture in the organization, where one does not have to depend on annual manager-led reviews.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Relationships and support: Mapping informal organization networks can provide deep insights on how work actually gets done in an organization. One can measure levels of collaboration, social cohesion and support in teams, as well as identify key influencers, mentors and technical experts. This can be done through simple network surveys or by mining digital communication (such as email, slack, messenger, etc.).
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    A variety of tools are available for each of the elements above. Organizations can pick a combination of these, or a single comprehensive platform to measure and enhance the employee experience.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Much like managing customer experience, managing employee experience is becoming critical to remain competitive in the cognitive computing era.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
